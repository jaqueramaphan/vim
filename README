This directory contains my Vim settings.  Here is how to use them:

If on Unix, you should have the following in your home directory:
- a directory called .vim
- a file called .vimrc
- a file called .gvimrc

If on Windows, you should have the following in your home directory:
- a directory called vimfiles
- a file called _vimrc
- a file called _gvimrc

The directory should be this one (the one containing this README).

The vimrc file should contain the following line:
runtime vimrc

The gvimrc file should contain the following line:
runtime gvimrc

That is all.
