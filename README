This directory contains my Vim settings.  For Vim to read it properly, do the
following:

- on Unix, this directorys should be named ".vim"; on Windows, "vimfiles"
- it should be in your home directory
- also in your home directory, you need a .vimrc file with one line:
runtime vimrc
- and a .gvimrc file with the line:
runtime gvimrc
